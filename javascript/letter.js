// Letter.js: Contains a constructor, Letter. This constructor should be able to either display an underlying character or a blank placeholder (such as an underscore), depending on whether or not the user has guessed the letter. That means the constructor should define:


// A string value to store the underlying character for the letter
// A boolean value that stores whether that letter has been guessed yet
// A function that returns the underlying character if the letter has been guessed, or a placeholder (like an underscore) if the letter has not been guessed
//A function that takes a character as an argument and checks it against the underlying character, updating the stored boolean value to true if it was guessed correctly
